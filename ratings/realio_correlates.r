# Idea: use a variety of opta stats and machine learning to predict realio's ratings.
# Motivation: 
# 1. Extrapolate to rest of league/back-cast 
# 2. Could be the numerator in "player utilization", ie whether a player lived up to his potential
# 3. Test the validity of Audi Player index / supplent their on-the-fly performance rating with my own
# 4. Compare to other rating systems around the internet liek whoscored and draftmls
